## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v20 or higher)
- An API key from [WeatherAPI.com](https://www.weatherapi.com/).

### Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-name>
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Set up environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project and add your WeatherAPI.com API key:

    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_WEATHER_API_KEY=your_weather_api_key_here
    ```

    If you are using Genkit's AI features, you will also need to configure your `GEMINI_API_KEY`.

4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    Open [http://localhost:9002](http://localhost:9002) with your browser to see the result.

## üìÅ Project Structure

-   `src/app/`: The main application routes and pages.
-   `src/components/`: Contains all the React components, organized by feature.
    -   `src/components/ui/`: ShadCN UI components.
    -   `src/components/weather/`: Components specific to the weather dashboard.
-   `src/context/`: React context providers, like the `WeatherContext`.
-   `src/ai/`: Contains Genkit flows for generative AI features.
-   `src/services/`: Services for interacting with external APIs (e.g., `weatherService.ts`).
-   `src/hooks/`: Custom React hooks.
-   `src/lib/`: Utility functions and constants.
-   `src/types/`: TypeScript type definitions.

## ü§ñ Genkit AI Flow

The application uses Genkit to generate dynamic CSS for the background based on the current weather condition.

-   **Flow Definition**: `src/ai/flows/generate-weather-background.ts`
-   **How it works**: When the weather data is fetched, the `DynamicBackground` component (`src/components/weather/DynamicBackground.tsx`) calls this flow with the current weather condition (e.g., "Sunny", "Rainy"). The flow uses an AI model to generate appropriate CSS, which is then applied to the background.

This creates a beautiful, ever-changing visual experience that matches the weather outside.
